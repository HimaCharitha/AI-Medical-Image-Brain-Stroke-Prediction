### AI-Medical-Image-Brain-Stroke-Prediction

BrainStrokePredictionAI is a deep learning project focused on using medical image analysis techniques to predict brain strokes from imaging data. This project utilizes Python, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, along with medical imaging datasets specific to brain images.

## Project Description
The goal of BrainStrokePredictionAI is to develop an AI model that can predict the likelihood of brain strokes from medical images. The project employs deep learning techniques for image classification or segmentation to assist in early diagnosis and intervention.

## Features
- Brain stroke prediction from medical imaging data
- Image preprocessing and augmentation for enhanced model performance
- Model training and evaluation scripts
- Visualization tools for interpreting model predictions

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

## Usage
Data Preparation
Organize your brain imaging dataset as follows:
dataset/
|-- train/
|   |-- stroke/
|   |-- no_stroke/
|-- validation/
|   |-- stroke/
|   |-- no_stroke/
|-- test/
|   |-- stroke/
|   |-- no_stroke/

## Training the Model
To train the model for stroke prediction, run:
python train.py --dataset_path path/to/dataset --model_type classification

## Evaluating the Model
Evaluate the trained model using:
python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/model --dataset_path path/to/dataset

## Inference
Perform inference on new brain images with:
python infer.py --model_path path/to/model --image_path path/to/image

## Datasets
You can use publicly available brain imaging datasets such as:

- ADNI
- BraTS
- ISLES

## Model Training
Adjust the training script as necessary to optimize model performance for stroke prediction.

## Results
After training, assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and classify between stroke and normal brain MRI Images.
